Allows users to deselect maps to avoid them in matchmaking.
Currently Support Halo CE / Halo 2 (Classic and Anniversary) / Halo 3

Steps:
If installation folder is not shown (and you receive the popup) first click the button to find your installation folder.

If the box is checked, the map is active.
If the box is unchecked, the map is removed (and the word REMOVED is written to the file name).


At load if we cannot find your default MCC folder we ask for it.
